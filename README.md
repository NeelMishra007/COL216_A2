Design decisions

1. We have created MEM as a byte array (unsigned char) and it's Little Endian.
2. We initialize everything to 0.
3. We do complete tracking of registers as well as branch resolution.
4. We have implemented a complete forwarding unit which all types of forwading implemented.

Known issues in your implementation

1. No known issues in our code.
